/**
 * RequestEvent puts an Request (a one-time EventSource) in to the EventSource list of the simulator.
 *
 * The order here is three-fold.  If a Scheduler (or other actor) wants to make a request, which
 * may take time to satisfy but _which is wishes to remember_ (for its own stateful purposes), it
 * needs to:
 * 1. return a RequestEvent from its own sampleNextEvent method
 * 2. the RequestEvent, when chosen for simulation, puts the Request _into the list of event sources_.
 *    At this point, the RequestEvent is a marker which the Scheduler can use to update its own state
 *    from the EventHistory, in the future.
 * 3. Finally, the Request proposes a single FulfillEvent.  When the FulfillEvent is accepted, the
 *    Request's action is performed and the Request is removed from the list of EventSources.
